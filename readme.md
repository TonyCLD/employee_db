Employee Database project.
=========================  

This project takes input from the comand line and uses classes and prompts to gether information and put it in Objects that can be used by the program. 
It is not complete, building the html pages and testing of the coding is not complete. There is also additional logic to work out as to how to save each of the entries and allow more to be made.  

In the video I did want to show that by changing one word, I could produce the needed information for each employee.
